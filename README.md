# To-Do-List
A To-Do list app to help Drew keep track of what chores, errands, or activities need to be done. With a completed and deleted button to help track progress and local save so that if the window closes the to-dos can return. Was a fun project to work with some new styling techniques and JavaScript practice for local memory and using icons from font awesome.
